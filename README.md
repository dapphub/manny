Manny O'Malley, Malicious Oracle
===

Manny O'Malley (MO) is an oracle that produces an somewhat reliable USD feed, except when MO detects an opportunity to profit by lying.

Any time MO takes your money, you are required to say, "Gosh darnit, Manny!"

MO is not very good at iterated games. His memory is bad. He's not very tricky either, if he sees an opportunity he takes it.

He doesn't follow any of these rules reliably. He's an internet troll, not a game theorist!
